# Example: Business Acquisition Decision

This example demonstrates how to use DRE to analyze a complex business decision.

## Scenario
Your company is considering acquiring a competitor. You need to analyze whether this acquisition makes strategic sense.

## Step-by-Step Reasoning

### 1. Define the Objective
```javascript
{
  "thought": "Should we acquire TechCorp to expand our market position?",
  "thought_type": "objective"
}
```

### 2. Develop Hypotheses
```javascript
// Hypothesis 1: Financial benefit
{
  "thought": "Acquiring TechCorp will increase our revenue by 40% and give us 60% market share",
  "thought_type": "hypothesis",
  "dependencies": ["<objective_id>"],
  "confidence": 0.7
}

// Hypothesis 2: Cultural risk
{
  "thought": "Cultural differences between companies will cause talent exodus",
  "thought_type": "hypothesis", 
  "dependencies": ["<objective_id>"],
  "confidence": 0.5
}
```

### 3. Identify Key Assumptions
```javascript
{
  "thought": "TechCorp's customer base will remain loyal post-acquisition",
  "thought_type": "assumption",
  "dependencies": ["<hypothesis_1_id>"],
  "confidence": 0.6
}

{
  "thought": "We can integrate TechCorp's technology stack within 6 months",
  "thought_type": "assumption",
  "dependencies": ["<hypothesis_1_id>"],
  "confidence": 0.4
}
```

### 4. Break Down into Sub-Problems
```javascript
{
  "thought": "Analyze customer overlap and retention risk",
  "thought_type": "sub_problem",
  "dependencies": ["<customer_assumption_id>"]
}

{
  "thought": "Conduct technical due diligence on system compatibility",
  "thought_type": "sub_problem",
  "dependencies": ["<tech_assumption_id>"]
}
```

### 5. Plan Actions
```javascript
{
  "thought": "Survey 100 TechCorp customers about acquisition concerns",
  "thought_type": "action",
  "dependencies": ["<customer_subproblem_id>"],
  "action_request": {
    "tool": "customer_survey",
    "parameters": {
      "sample_size": 100,
      "questions": ["loyalty", "concerns", "alternatives"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Process Evidence
```javascript
{
  "thought": "Survey results: 70% of customers would consider switching providers",
  "thought_type": "evidence",
  "dependencies": ["<survey_action_id>"]
}
```

### 7. Invalidate Assumptions if Needed
```javascript
// The evidence contradicts our assumption
{
  "thought_id": "<customer_assumption_id>",
  "reason": "Survey shows 70% of customers would consider leaving"
}
```

### 8. Synthesize Findings
```javascript
{
  "thought": "Acquisition carries high risk due to customer retention issues and technical complexity",
  "thought_type": "synthesis",
  "dependencies": ["<evidence_id>", "<tech_assumption_id>"]
}
```

## Key Takeaways

- DRE helps structure complex decisions into manageable components
- Assumptions are explicitly tracked and can be invalidated based on evidence
- The dependency graph ensures all related thoughts are updated when assumptions change
- The reasoning process becomes auditable and reproducible
